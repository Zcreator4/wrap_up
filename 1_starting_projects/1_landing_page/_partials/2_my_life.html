                                I was born in Orange County, California, and moved to the Bay Area when I was 4. I attended Melrose Leadership Academy from 1st to 3rd grade, and Montessori Family School from 4th to 8th grade. I turned 14 years old on May 25th, and I will be attending Salesian next year for High School.

                             I am thankful for all the everything that I have learned throughout the experiences I have had. One obstacle that I have overcome this year is the obstacle of of being a mixed boy in a primarly white school. This has been hard as many of my fellow classmates had different interests as me. I also had the problem of my culture in my household being different from many of my peers. I overcame this by just being me and not allowing anyone else to change who I am.
