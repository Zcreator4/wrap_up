                                The main thing that stands out to me about the Hidden Genius Project mission statement is that the program educates our brothers to tranform their lives and their communnities. I have also noticed that the community is very centered around helping others around us, and helping each other achieve our goals. The mnission statement also stands out to me as it talks about teaching young black men to code, entreprenuership, and leadership skills. I believe all of these skills are vital for us to become succsesful.
